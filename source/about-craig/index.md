Hi, I’m Craig Sturgis. I live in Indianapolis, I work for a quickly growing [software company][1] managing a technical team and writing code, and I like to play [music][2]. I’m[![SMheadshots-138][4]][4] always busy on one adventure or another, either in the literal [traveling][4] sense, in the local [running][5] around the neighborhood sense, or in the new hobby project or “take a look, it’s in a [book][6]” sense.

Catch me if you can! (Odds are you can, I don’t run nearly as fast as I used to)
