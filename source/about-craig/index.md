Hi, I’m Craig Sturgis. I live in Indianapolis, I co-founded a new [software start-up company][1] where I lead product and development, and I like to play [music][2]. I’m always busy on one adventure or another, either in the literal [traveling][4] sense, in the local [running][5] around the neighborhood sense, or in the new hobby project or “take a look, it’s in a [book][6]” sense. 

The title of this site is an homage to one of my favorite [quotes][7] of all time, from one of my favorite movies. I would have used a quote from my favorite movie, but the [obvious ones][8] would probably give people the wrong idea.

Catch me if you can! (Odds are you can, I don’t run nearly as fast as I used to)
