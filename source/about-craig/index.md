Hi, I’m Craig Sturgis. I live in Indianapolis, and I make my bones as a product management director at [Angie's List][1]. I also do some [software and product consulting and coaching][2] here and there. Previously, I co-founded a data driven home management [company][3] where I led product management and software development from concept to alpha to fundraise to launch to rapid iteration to rough landing.

When I'm not working I like to play [music][4]. I’m always busy on one adventure or another, either in the literal [traveling][5] sense, in the local [running][6] around the neighborhood sense, or in the new hobby project or “take a look, it’s in a [book][7]” sense.

The title of this site is an homage to one of my favorite [quotes][8] of all time, from one of my favorite movies. I would have used a quote from my favorite movie, but the [obvious ones][9] would probably give people the wrong idea.
