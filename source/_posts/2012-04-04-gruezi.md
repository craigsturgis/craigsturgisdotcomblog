Hello, world! Seems like an appropriate beginning for the first entry on a personal site for someone who writes code for a living.

I’m not sure what I will do with this site content wise since I post things in so many other places, but check back or subscribe to the feed, and you just might be pleasantly surprised. (Disclaimer: you also might not.)

For now, this is the somewhat useful result of yet another quick hobby project.  I’ll take it!
