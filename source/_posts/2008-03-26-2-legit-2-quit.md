Well here I am with my fancy new website, with my own hosted blog powered by [WordPress][1], with syndication feeds powered by [FeedBurner][2]. Hooray!  I feel like I’m now officially a king nerd, what with a main website that has actual content on it.  I’m planning on always having the blog up front, but toying with a couple of side projects in Python and / or Ruby on the side with the same domain.

I have several ideas for new posts coming up, but like the infamous (at least to me and possibly two or three other people) grape Mr. Misty review, I’ll have to sit down and write them soon or they’ll vanish forever.  Since I don’t want to cannibalize the content of said posts here, I’ll leave you with an idea I’ve been working on recently:

A line of designer purses, priced more modestly than Coach, named Dauber.
