**"Classic hits" is an attempt to consolidate all my internet written content, and also to revisit it from the present.**

One of my original stream of consciousness [updates][1], this one from December of 2003.  My musings on longing a bit for the real world are funny now given I would kill for 3 weeks off for Christmas even if I had to work 100 hours next week, but hey the grass is always greener.  Sometimes I think I’d like to go back to school full time, but those thoughts are fleeting.

The mention of my astronomy class is a funny memory, because somehow my lab group ended up being me and three girls, and I ended up just doing all the lab work and then explaining it to them.[^1]  All three were nice- one of them was attractive, another was extremely attractive, and was the subject of another throwaway comment, but she gave me the laugh and the arm touch I ended up commenting on in another entry.  If only I could have developed some more self confidence earlier in my life, ha.  C’est la vie.  I probably wouldn’t even recognize her face if I saw her today anyhow.  The mention of the discrete math is a less funny memory, as that class mostly sucked.

 [^1]: Way to be arrogant and condescending, 2008 me. I did do a lot of the work in that class but mostly because it made sense to me right away. I'm sure they would have been fine without me. (08/2013) 

Snoop style izzle speak has mostly disappeared in the intervening 5 years, aside from the occasional extremely lame dad or over-ironic hipster.  The original image that was there was the photoshopped weather map with every word ending in izzle.  It’s decidedly less funny now, heh.

## I’m your huckleberry

Yes, folks it’s that time of the year again- finals week in lovely West Lafayette, Indiana. I’m not really all that well prepared, but then again I never am really. Only a couple of my 5 tests are going to be really difficult anyway, and the rest should be more common sense than anything. 
It’s always weeks like this when I wish I was out of school and in the “real world.” Only I think I would probably be too hip, fresh, and in-your-face for most of the rest of the housemates on the show, and would never show up to the ludicrous novelty job on time. In all seriousness, it’s going to be nice to (probably)[^2] make more money than I am now and truly live on my own without having to take out loans to do so, but now that I think about it I’m perfectly happy going to school and learning stuff. It’s just when you have to prove that you learned something that it gets annoying.

 [^2]: Definitely. I was paid decently well for a college student, but not like an adult, haha. (08/2013) 

Speaking of school, that reminds me- one of the girls from my astronomy class (hi Natulya) called me out during lab regarding my little rant piece that you can still read below a while back. She asked if I considered myself a “Nice Guy” and if I was bitter about girls. While my tone may have come off as bitter, that’s not the effect I was going for entirely. I’ll be the first to admit I don’t have all the answers, but I’ve got a pretty good handle on some of them I think. That doesn’t mean it’s actually helped me any, ha. Anywho, any other questions on philosophy of relationships, discrete math, or Seinfeld references can be posted in the comments[^3].

 [^3]: Asking for comments is luckily an internet trend that has mostly died out, mostly because comments sections are with few exceptions the most awful medium there is. (08/2013) 

After watching Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory on tv this weekend, it makes me wish there were more “children’s” stories that have kind of a strange imaginative angle to them. It makes me want to go back and read some Roald Dahl and Lewis Carroll.

And finally, I would like to try and convince people to stop spouting Snoopspeak (AOL commercial? Come on, Calvin) before I go insane. Flippity Floppity Floo. If we don’t stop now, this could be the future……

Thank you to the SA forums, one of my primary sources of entertainment[^4]

 [^4]: Very much not the case anymore, but I am glad they're still around for occasional bits of reference. (08/2013)
