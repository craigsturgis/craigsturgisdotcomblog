Throughout the site and in social media, I often make use of referral links when I am providing a link to something I've enjoyed and recommend to others. I do my best to be up front about this, and I will never write about something just in an attempt to get referral bonuses. Feel free to use your own or an alternate referral link on any of these, but if you find out about something from me and want to purchase it, by all means [be excellent][1] to me and follow the link to do so.
